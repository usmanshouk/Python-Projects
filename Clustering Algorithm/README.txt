Requirements:
For this programme to run the local machine must have installed python 3.0 or above.
How to run the code:
Import the code to a compiler and then write the command  python3 followed by location of file in the terminal
and then press enter. It will run the code.
What will this code do:
This code is initialised with 1 dataset  of 5 points and 2 centroids of two dimension. This algorithm calculates
the distance between each point of dataset and centroid of each cluster, then save this point to a cluster nearest
to this point. And then it calculates the mean of points in each new cluster and declares them as new centroids.
This code repeats this process for two iteratons.
